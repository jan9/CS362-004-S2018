Testing -> gainCard()

Test 1: empty supply pile

   1-A Ran out of copper card

   1-B Ran out of silver card

   1-C Ran out of gold card


Test 2: supply card not used in the game

   2-A Copper card not used in the game

   2-B Silver card not used in the game

   2-C Gold card not used in the game 


Test 3: check if flags work correctly

   3-A check if toFlag == 0, then add a card to discard on current player. 
    Return value should be 0.

   3-B check if toFlag == 1, then add a card to deck on current player. 
    Return value should be 0.

   3-C check if toFlag == 2, then add a card to hand on current player. 
    Return value should be 0. 

   3-D if toFlag < 0 (i.e. invalid), then discard a card and return 0.

   3-E if toFlag > 2 (i.e. invalid) return 0.


Test 4: check if the function decrease the number in supply pile and return 0

   4-A Check to see if number of copper card decreased

   4-B Check to see if number of silver card decreased

   4-C Check to see if number of gold card decreased
